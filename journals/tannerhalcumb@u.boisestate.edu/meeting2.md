# Meeting 2

- Attendance: Everyone present

For this week's meeting, we narrowed down and decided on a project. We want to take a Raspberry Pi 3
and create a door monitor system. Our thought is to accomplish this by having a motion sensor that triggers
a video camera to record someone at the door. Next we plan to have these occurences recorded and sent
to either an email or through text message. The concept is essentially a Ring doorbell clone. Provided
we find success, we also considered adding a speaker and a button to trigger the doorbell. This would 
further establish our device as a comparable home security system. After establishing a game plan, we 
started writing our epic and selecting hardware components. 

Tasks for the week:
- Obtain hardware via Amazon
- Research programming options
