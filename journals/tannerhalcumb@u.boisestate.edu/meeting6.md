# Meeting 6

- Attendance: Ryan missed last week, but everyone present this week

Looking back at the previous week we tried to establish a plan to get our continuous integration
involved with our project. The difficult part was how to break down our source code down into
Python's bytecode and connect to github actions. After simplifying a bit, we were able to reach
success. For this week, we have started to document our hardware connections to stay consistent
across the team. We discussed some of the reasons there have been difficulties using our motion
sensor with our gpio pins, as well as solutions. While its a work in progress, the camera seems
to be pretty straight forward. For the upcoming week, we delegated which user story each of us 
would write and intend to collaborate again to insure we've covered the major goals. 

Tasks for the week:
- Write user story and tasks for motion sensor
- Continue testing hardware component functionality
