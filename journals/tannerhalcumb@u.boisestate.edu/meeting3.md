# Meeting 3

- Attendance: Everyone present

Since our project requires some hardware components, we thought it necessary to have these selected as soon
as possible. At the point of our meeting, I had already placed the order. With these established, we discussed
our options for potential frameworks. While we are working in Python, we imagine having some form of interface 
to interact with our raspberry pi camera system. Whether this manifests as a Web App or a desktop application,
we considered utilizing a framework to make this aspect more seamless. In the mean time, we called upon the 
TKinter library to produce a basic GUI and simulate our "Hello World" program. Moving forward, we need to begin
experimenting with our hardware and testing these components.

Tasks for the week:
- Test individual hardware components
- Look into build systems applicable to our project
