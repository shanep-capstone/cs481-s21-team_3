# Meeting 1

- Attendance: Everyone present

During this meeting we discussed potential project avenues. The first we considered was a Discord bot, 
although had various ideas for where to take this concept. We thought about some sort of scheduling, 
management system, or even one that incorporated github commits. If we utilized geo-location, we could
provide options for proximity and the availability for meetings. Another Discord bot could simply allow
the server to settle disputes with mini games, or return interesting facts/jokes given the according 
command. I did some additional research to see the weight of this project. Getting a discord bot up and
running seems reasonable, and there are various language choices. Then it is fairly open ended as far as 
which commands we decide to implement. The next route we discussed was some sort of embedded hardware system. 
Something along the lines of a ring doorbell clone, an automatic door locker, or a robot that does something 
interesting. Kyle and Ryan both have Raspberry Pi's available. While I only have an Arduino at the moment, I 
have been meaning to get a Pi myself, and this would be perfect justification. Finally we threw out the idea 
of a web crawler/scraper. An interesting thought, to create a generic web crawler with an interface to allow 
the user to supply a term. The crawler could then scan to locate significant links or quotes in relation to 
the provided phrase.

Tasks for the week:
- Continue brainstorming project ideas
- Research more details on our high level project avenues
