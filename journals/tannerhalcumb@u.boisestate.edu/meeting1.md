# Meeting 1

- Attendance: Everyone present

During this meeting we discussed potential project avenues. The first we considered was a Discord bot, 
although had various ideas for where to take this concept. We thought about some form of scheduling, 
management system, or even one that involved tracking a git repository. The next route we discussed was some 
sort of embedded hardware system. Something along the lines of a ring doorbell clone, an automatic door 
locker, or a robot that does something interesting. Finally we threw out the idea of a web crawler/scraper. 
Maybe create a generic crawler that could accumulate relevant links to a user supplied term.

Tasks for the week:
- Continue brainstorming project ideas
- Research more details on our potential avenues
