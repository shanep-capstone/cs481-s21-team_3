# Meeting 3

- Attendance: Everyone present

As of this week all team members have the required hardware. Which means we can finally start messing around with setting up some sort of early prototype. During our meeting we went over some possible build system approaches. One build system approach we thought is to implement a simple makefile to help automate some of the start up process with our project. Furthermore, we contemplated setting up something to handle missing packages. Going forward, I plan on looking into creating an implementation in order to install any missing python packages. At least an implementation to install missing packages on a linux distro such as Raspbian. A cross platform implementation may be outside the scope of our primary goal as well as my technical skills. Overall, the project off to a smooth start and I am excited to dive further into the different aspects required to build up our idea. 

Tasks for the week:
- Sync up motion sensor, camera, and raspberry pi
- Figure out some sort of build system for our project
