# Meeting 6

- Attendance: Everyone present

During the past week I finally figured out the motion sensor! Apparently I simply had the 
wiring backwards on our specific model of motion sensor. From what I researched(googled) most of the motion sensors are setup slightly different than the model of motion sensor we are using? Also, during the past week we got the continuous integration up and running with some simple tests. Going forward I would like to expand to the testing suite and continuous integration. Furthermore, I plan to create user stories related to the gui aspect of our project and start building up the gui using python3's tkinter gui framework. 


Tasks for the week:
- Expand testing
- Expand continuous integration
- Write user stories/task for gui tkinter interface.
