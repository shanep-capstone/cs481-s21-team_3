# Meeting 1

- Attendance: _Everyone present_

During the first meeting, we mostly worked on getting the bookkeeping work completed. We worked through the team contract and readme. Then continued on to brainstorm project ideas we may be interested in building throughout the semester.  
For project ideas we played around with the idea of using raspberry pi's and/or arduino in order implement a more hardware based project. Hardware based projects could include cloning the ring door bell or building a simple robot of some sort.  
Some of the other ideas we talked about were discord bots and web scrappers. We are not exactly sure what data to scrape off the web but I do like the idea of this project. Web scrapping could lead into a machine learning/NLP project where the scrapped data used to train the machine learning model.

My task for this week:
* Narrow down project ideas, in order to solidify project idea.
* Research the necessary tech to build the more exciting projects.
