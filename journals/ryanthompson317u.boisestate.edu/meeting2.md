# Meeting 2

- Attendance: Everyone present

Our final project is officially going to be a raspberry pi based experiment. Our goal is to
transform a raspberry pi into a security camera. This will be done by attaching a motion sensor and a camera to the raspberry pi. At which point python libraries ought to be able to sync up all of our hardware. 

We have established the main hardware we will be using and now are looking more into the required
software to create our project. Python's GPIO and PiCamera libraries seem promising for working with the hardware. Once we acquire our hardware, we will need to test our hardware with the libraries to know for sure. Furthermore, we are looking into frameworks or other potential routes to create some sort of graphical user interface. This will take a little more research.

Tasks for the week:
- Mess around with raspberry pi motion sensor
- Mess around with raspberry pi camera
- Gather any remaining hardware I may need
- Look into potential user interface frameworks
