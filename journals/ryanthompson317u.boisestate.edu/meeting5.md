# Meeting 5

- Attendance: I Missed the meeting 

Unfortunately, due to outside issues I missed the meeting. However, I was to get
a summary of the meeting from Kyle. We went over continuous integration options 
for our python raspberry pi project. With our project being a bit more hardware
orientated, CI will be interesting. We are thinking about partitioning our into 
smaller chunks in order to implement CI to the more testable software aspects of 
our project. Furthermore, I am still working to get the motion sensor dialed in. 
For some reason I am struggling to get it to work just right. 


My task for this week:

- Compartmentalize our project for CI implementation.
- Finally get the motion sensor to work properly.
