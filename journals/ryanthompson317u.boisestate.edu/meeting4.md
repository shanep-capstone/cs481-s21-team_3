# Meeting 4

- Attendance: Everyone present

During meeting four we went over potential testing systems for our project. One possibilty was pytest. 
PyTest could help with testing some the simple aspects of our program. I have been playing around with 
the raspberry pi's motion sensor and camera. The camera fired up and worked without any issues. The motion
sensor has been more tempermental. Therefore, during the next several days I am hoping to work out the
issues with the motion sensor. Furthermore, I am looking forward to researching other testing options and 
potential continous integration methods.  

Tasks for the week:
- Dial in the raspberry pi's motion sensor
- Research potential testing methods
- Research potential continous integration methods
