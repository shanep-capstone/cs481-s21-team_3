# Meeting 5

- Attendance: Ryan not present, rest present.

For our meeting today Ryan had missed the usual meeting time. To suplement the
missed time, I let Ryan know what we talked about today so we could all be
on the sam pageI spent the majority of my work time this week on research. 
Due to some other time constrains I was unable to get much done int he beginning 
of the week. Ryan was able to get the testing lab requirements underway with a 
successful pytest implementation which was extremely helpful. On 2/25 morning I 
met with Shane to go over some options for our team to implement CI in the next
lab which was helpful for planning the week to come.

My task for this week:

- Start working on CI and planning ahead
- Try and get something running using the motion sensor
