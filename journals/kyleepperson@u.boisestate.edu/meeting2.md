# Meeting 2

- Attendance: Everyone present

Our team meeting last week started with us going over some of our project ideas and considering new ones if we
came up with any in the mean time. We broke down each of our ideas to really think of the components involved
along that development process such as things to buy, frameworks we could leverage during development etc. We 
utlimately decided to go with our raspberry pi project where we would make some sort of front door security 
camera that leveraged a special camera and library for the raspberry pi and some hardware like motion sensors.

After making that decision, the remainder of the week went towards crafting our Epic. We got some stuff within a
Google Document so we could all work on it at the same time, and we made some adjustments along the way until tuesday.
Ryan really swooped in and cleaned it up and worked on finalizing the content and formatting which was great to 
see and really was a life saver as that due date approached. 

Until today (2/4/21), I have been spending my time pondering the tech aspects for that upcoming lab and 
what we might want to consider in that lab. Additionally, I went ahead and purchased some of the hardware
needed inorder to get my raspberry pi up and working and have the necessary devices to connect to it.

My task for this week:

- Go over the tech lab and consider what needs to be added after our meeting
- Setup working raspberry pi and get system running
- (Working ahead) Start thinking about CI/CD options for our project
