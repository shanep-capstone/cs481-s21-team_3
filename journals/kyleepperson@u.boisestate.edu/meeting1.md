# Meeting 1

- Attendance: Everyone present

We started this meeting by quickly going over the Setup Lab to ensure we had everything in order.
After, we started working on brainstorming project ideas. We tossed out a few ideas, but focused more on format.
Some ideas we came up with was a GitHub Discord bot that follows a repo's changes and posts updates to some discord channel, 
an embedded project for a moterized device that could be attached to door locks so it would allow the door to be locked remotely
although we did mention that there could be potential issues with 3D printers and hardware requiremts for an embedded project, 
and a generic web scraper that can be used to specify what your scraping for and collect that data/generate 
some sort of graphical report. We tossed out a few more ideas but these were certainly the more fleshed out
over the others. The meeting concluded with us agreeing that we should take some more time
to flesh out some more ideas or possibly details on our existing ideas. During the meeting I noted some of our
project ideas and posted them in our Discord channel for record.

My task for this week:

- Check over the Setup Lab requirements once more before its due date Tuesday
- Continue thinking of possible project ideas for our next meeting
