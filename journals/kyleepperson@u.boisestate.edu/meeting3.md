# Meeting 3

- Attendance: Everyone present

This week was a calm week in terms of work load. We had our team meeting and setup a good document for our
tech lab so we could work on that at the same time. We essentially stated to work in the same style as last week
where each person could add stuff as they get time. From there I ended up having a free day so I did some research
on the tech we each discussed and wrote that up and put it in the readme. For the remainder of the week I have been 
pondering on CI solutions and trying to determine the most effective way for our team to implement such considering
we are writing in python, on a raspberry pi, with extra hardware required. 

My task for this week:

- Work on a CI solution
- Check with professor about CD requirements for python program
