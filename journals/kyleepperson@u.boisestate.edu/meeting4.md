# Meeting 4

- Attendance: Everyone present

This week was another slow-ish week working on the project. I did have the ability to finally
get around to test my hardware to ensure that everything was working and was able to get the camera
up and running in python but have yet to work with the motion sensor. We discussed a possible issue
with the motion sensor running coninuiously that I wanted to take a look into this week. During our
meeting today we discussed testing, which I will be considering PyTest to learn about that and 
how it fits into our project. Lastly, I wanted to try and book some time with Shane to consider
a strategy for implementing CI for our project.

My task for this week:

- Reach out for CI help / options
- Look through PyTest and learn about it for our project
- Try and get something running use the motion sensor
