### Raspberry Pi Security Camera GUI  
&nbsp;   

## User Story

As a user of the raspberry pi security camera I need a GUI in order to be able 
to manage the camera's live video feed and manage previously recorded videos.

## Tasks

1. I will build up a GUI for the user to interact with the raspberry pi security camera using the tkinter python module. 
2. I will implement a feature so that the user will be able to use the GUI in order to turn the security camera on or off.
3. I will implement a feature so that the user will be able to view the video feed through the GUI
4. I will implement a feature so that the user will be able to view previously recorded videos through the GUI.
5. I will build up an interface so that the user will be able to delete or download previously recorded videos through the GUI.


### Time estimation method

I am estimating each task will take about 2 hours to build, implement, and test. Which
equates to about 10 hours or work total. 

## Definition of Done

- Task 1 DOD - I will be done when the user is able to simply access the camera through
  a python tkinter GUI. Using the GUI, the user be able to confirm the camera is connected and alive. Therefore, task 1 will be more of a smoke test. At this point the GUI will also be able to pass some simple tests with the test.sh script.
- Task 2 DOD - Task 2 will be complete when the user is able to turn the camera on or off
  using the GUI.
- Task 3 DOD - Task 3 will be complete when the user is able to view live video feed from
  camera while using the GUI.
- Task 4 DOD - Task 4 will be done when the user is able to view previously recorded 
  videos via GUI.
- Task 5 DOD - Task 5 will be complete when the user is able to manage previously recorded
  videos, such as deleting or downloading the recorded videos.
